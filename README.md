# codeily
> Does a cuddly job of retrieving code from Github and installing it on a server.
## Getting Started
```shell
npm install codeily
```
Once the plugin has been installed, it may be run using this:
```shell
node app/app.js
```
## Assumptions
Codeily requires this to be in place:
- A file named ```_provision_vars.js``` at the root of Codeily, with content like this:
```
[
  {
    "path": "\var\www\html\\",
    "repo": "https://github.com/test/test.git",
    "branch": "master"
  }
]
```
- A file named ```codeily.json``` in the repo being called is optional, containing something below. Of course, if a script is sited, it must be included also.
```
{
  "ignore": [".git","README.md"],
  "script_after": ["codeily_script_after.sh"]
}
```

## Development
Requires:
- A Linux system.
- git: ```sudo apt-get install git```
- grunt-cli: ```npm install -g grunt-cli```
Run:
- Normal: ```grunt```
- Include github calls: ```grunt mochaTest:all```
